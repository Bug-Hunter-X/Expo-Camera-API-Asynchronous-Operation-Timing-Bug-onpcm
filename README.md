# Expo Camera API Asynchronous Operation Timing Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API alongside asynchronous tasks.  When lengthy network requests or other time-consuming operations are performed concurrently with camera frame capture, the camera's preview can freeze, display corrupted images, or crash the application.  The accompanying solution showcases a method to mitigate this issue by synchronizing the camera's operations with the completion of the asynchronous tasks.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Run `expo start`.
5. Observe the camera preview. The bug will manifest as unexpected behavior (freeze, corruption) when an asynchronous operation is initiated. 

## Solution

The solution provided incorporates asynchronous operation management techniques to ensure that camera operations only proceed once any pending long-running tasks are completed. This prevents race conditions and the timing issues leading to inconsistent camera behavior.
