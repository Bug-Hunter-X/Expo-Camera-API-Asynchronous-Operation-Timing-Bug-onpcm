This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API in conjunction with other asynchronous operations.  The issue is that if a network request or other asynchronous task is taking longer than the Camera's frame capture cycle, the camera's state might get prematurely updated, leading to errors, crashes, or unexpected behavior.  The camera preview might freeze or show corrupted images. The error messages are inconsistent and may not directly point to the root cause.
